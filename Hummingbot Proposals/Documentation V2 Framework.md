The main goal of this proposal is to improve the documentation of the v2 strategies since they are becoming mainstream in Hummingbot and the current information provided does not get into much details on how the framework works under the hood.

Useful links before getting started:
- **Official Docs:** https://hummingbot.org/strategies/
- **Github code:** https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot-site/tree/main/docs/v2-strategies

What is expected for this bounty:
- **Strategies V2 page:** there are some concepts mixed and can be simplified generating more emphasis on when to use each type of strategy
